###Some useful links
------------
-The basics of using git with GitHub: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
-Unity Scripting API reference: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/
-Some Unity 5 tutorials: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/5-tutorials
###Conventions
---------------
-If you are going to make changes to the file structure do it from within Unity and not from Finder/Terminal. Unity creates metadata when files get added or deleted, so if you want to add files drag and drop them into unity.
-Directories/folders that have been created by us will be lowercase, Directories created by unity or included as plugins/libraries will begin with a capital letter instead.
